  abstract = "24 consistent global land cover maps at 300 m spatial resolution, on an annual basis from 1992 to 2015. The annual LC maps v2.0.7 for years 2000, 2005 and 2010 replace completely the 'v1.6.1 epoch-based' dataset as the annual LC maps v2.0.7 have been improved both in the representation of the areas stable over time and in the characterization of change. Each pixel value corresponds to the label of a land cover class defined based on the UN Land Cover Classification System (LCCS). LCCS classifiers support the further conversion into Plant Functional Types distribution required by the Earth System Models. The typology counts 22 classes. The 24 LC maps series is delivered along with 4 quality flags which document the products.
  
  Broad classification:
  
  - 0: No data
  - 10-20: Cropland
  - 30-40: Mosaic cropland / Natural vegetation
  - 50-90: Tree cover
  - 100-122: Shrublands
  - 130: Grasslands
  - 140-153: Sparse vegetation
  - 160-180: Flooded areas
  - 190: Urban areas
  - 200-202: Bare areas
  - 210: Water bodies
  - 220: Permanent ice and snow",
